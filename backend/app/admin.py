"""The shared M2M admin client.

`AdminClient.from_client_credentials(...)` runs the `client_credentials` grant against the
Login API once, then caches and silently refreshes the token. We point it at three services
that all accept the same M2M token:

  * auth_url   -> auth-api (/auth/v1)  — `client.users.get(...)`
  * logs_url   -> logs-api (/logs/v1)  — `client.logs.write([...])`

The client is created lazily and reused for the process. It is never exposed to the browser.
